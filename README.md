```lrc
[02:05.87] Out of fear, we kept running
[02:09.91] Tried to hide away
[02:14.25] Can you hear, war is coming?
[02:18.38] Beckoning our fate
[02:27.38] 
[02:21.93] This is the day that we stand up
[02:24.09] This is the day we fight
[02:25.96] We'll take our place, we won't give in
[02:28.06] Our victory's in sight
[02:30.31] Only a sword in our hand but
[02:32.28] We enter the lion's den
[02:34.18] We're not waiting for a war
[02:37.49] We bring the war to them
[02:49.49] 
[02:56.21] We bring the war to them
